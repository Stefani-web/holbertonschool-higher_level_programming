The project focuses on the advanced use of classes and objects in Python. Here are the key points of this project:

**Classes:** Classes are models that allow you to create objects. They encapsulate variables **(attributes)** and **functions (methods)** into a single entity. Classes serve as a basis for creating **instances of objects**.
**Inheritance:** Python supports class inheritance, which means that a derived class can inherit attributes and methods from a base class. This allows you to reuse existing code and create class hierarchies.
**Special methods:** Python offers special methods (also called magic methods) that allow you to customize the behavior of objects. For example, the __init__ method is used to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created.
**Encapsulation:** Classes allow you to encapsulate data and functionality, which promotes modularity and code readability.
