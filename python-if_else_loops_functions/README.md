**Python** is a programming language that provides flow control features such as **conditional if-else** statements, **loops**, and **functions**.

**if-else** conditional statements allow you to test a condition and execute a block of code based on the result of that condition. For example, we can use an if statement to check if a variable has a certain value and execute a block of code if it does. If the condition is not met, we can use an else statement to execute another block of code.

**Loops** are used to execute a block of code multiple times based on a condition. Python offers two types of **loops**: for loops and while loops.

- **for** loops are used to iterate over a sequence of elements such as a list, tuple or string.
- **while** loops are used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is

Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be called from other parts of the program. **Functions** help structure the code and make it easier to maintain. In **Python**, you can define your own functions using the def keyword. **Functions** can take **arguments** as input and return values as output.

In summary, **if-else** conditional statements, **loops** and **functions** are key elements of the **Python** language that allow you to control the flow of program execution and to structure the code to make it more readable and easier to understand ðŸš€ </p>

## âž¤ INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

```
Python Scripts:
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

```
## âž¤ EXAMPLES

1: Conditional if-else statement,
*In this example, we are testing whether the xexexe variable*
```
x = 10

if x > 0:
    print("x est positif")
elif x < 0:
    print("x est nÃ©gatif")
else:
    print("x est nul")
```
2: Loop for,
*In this example we use a loop to iterate over the fruite list*
```
fruits = ["pomme", "banane", "orange"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print("J'aime les " + fruit)
```
*In this example, we use a while loop to display numbers from 1 to 5. As long as the variable is inf*
```
i = 1

while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```
*In this example, we define a function calculate_surface_circle which takes as input the radius of a circle and returns*
```
def calculer_surface_cercle(rayon):
    surface = 3.14 * rayon ** 2
    return surface

rayon = 5
surface = calculer_surface_cercle(rayon)
print("La surface du cercle est :", surface)
```
