<p>

The **"Python - Classes and Objects"** project involves exploring and putting into practice the fundamental concepts of
 object-oriented programming (OOP) using the Python programming language. In this project, you will learn how to define classes and create objects,
 which are **instances of these classes**.

 You'll learn how to define attributes and methods in a class, and how to access these attributes and methods from the objects you create.
 Using real-world examples, you will also learn the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
 Encapsulation consists of grouping data (attributes) and the operations (methods) that manipulate them into a single entity, the class, to make them more modular and easy to manage.

 Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing classes, reusing and extending their functionality. Polymorphism allows you to use the same interface for objects of different **classes**, providing increased flexibility and extensibility in your code. This project will give you a solid understanding of basic OOP concepts in Python, which will allow you to create programs that are more modular, more flexible, and easier to maintain.
