**Introduction to SQL**
**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language specifically designed to store, retrieve, manage, or manipulate data within a relational database management system (RDBMS). Here are some key points to remember:

What is SQL?
SQL is used to access and manipulate databases.
It became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 19871.
**SQL features:**
Execute queries on a database.
Retrieve data from a database.
Insert new records into a database.
Update records in a database.
Delete records from a database.
Create new databases and tables.
Define stored procedures and views.
Grant permissions on tables, procedures, and views.
**SQL Versions:**
Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the language.
All SQL database management systems support at least the main commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar way.
**Note:** Most SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL1 standard.
Using SQL in a Website:
To create a website that displays data from a database, you will need:
A relational database management system (e.g., MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL).
A server-side scripting language, such as PHP or ASP.
Using SQL to retrieve the desired data.
Using HTML/CSS to style the page.
RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):
SQL is based on relational database management systems (RDBMS).
Data in an RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables.
Each table is made up of columns and rows.
Fields (columns) contain specific information about each record (row) in the table
