<p>

**The "Python - More Data Structures:** **Set, Dictionary"** project aims to deepen the understanding of advanced **data structures** in Python, including sets and **dictionaries**.

These data structures are crucial for the efficient manipulation and storage of data in many programming problems.

The project includes several exercises that explore different features and operations available with **sets and dictionaries**.

This includes operations such as adding, removing, and finding elements, as well as set operations such as union, intersection, and difference. Additionally, it covers advanced concepts such as manipulating nested **dictionaries** and sorting items alphabetically or **numerically**.

Through this project, developers will improve their understanding of **sets and dictionaries** in **Python**, allowing them to solve problems efficiently and elegantly, using the right data structures for each situation.
